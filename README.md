# powerbi-dashboards

Welcome to my repository of PowerBI personal projects! This space is dedicated to showcasing various data analysis and visualization projects I've undertaken using PowerBI. Each project demonstrates different techniques and approaches to solving data-driven problems, ranging from employee retention analysis, graph theory used for supermarket optimization and an executive view of digital marketing results.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of PowerBI files along with detailed explanations and instructions on how to recreate and explore the insights presented. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a student, or a professional looking to understand and apply PowerBI techniques, I hope you find these projects informative and inspiring.

Below, you'll find a summary of each project, including the main objectives and how to execute them:

## Employee Retention 

**Author**: Sebastian Ahumada.

**Date**: November 2023.

**Dataset**: https://github.com/Sebastian21Ahumada/python-notebooks/tree/main/datasets

The objective of this project is to visually present the results of a clustering and classification model to identify different employees within a company. Additionally, insights are provided to determine which group of employees has a higher attrition rate, what characteristics explain this trend, and useful metrics for decision-making and continuous improvement.

## Supermarket Optimization

**Author**: Sebastian Ahumada.

**Date**: May 2023.

**Dataset**: Comming soon in my github

The objective of this dashboard is to visually display the results obtained after applying graph theory to the sales information of a minimarket. The main idea is to identify customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, thus identifying products that, while not in the same category, may be closely related. In other words, the aim is to find an alternative way of classifying products based on consumer behavior rather than the characteristics of the products themselves.

## Executive Digital Marketing 

**Author**: Sebastian Ahumada.

**Date**: May 2023.

**Dataset**: [Executive Digital Marketin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sinderpreet/analyze-the-marketing-spending/data)
